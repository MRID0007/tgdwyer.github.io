## Introduction

This page will support the workshop solutions with a worked example of how we can use the observables, filled with pretty animations.

## Animation Generation

Consider the definitions for ranks, suits and cards, as per the workshop:

```typescript
const ranks = ['A', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K'] as const;
const suits = ['♠','♣','♦','♥'] as const;

// use typeof to define string literal types
type Rank = typeof ranks[number];
type Suit = typeof suits[number];

type Card = Readonly<{
  readonly suit: Suit;
  readonly rank: Rank;
}>;

const suits$ = from(suits)
const ranks$ = from(ranks)
```

Using the webtool, we can visualise each of these streams.

![Suit Observable Visualised](/assets/images/chapterImages/frpanimated/suit.gif)

To create a card, for each suit, we can look through each rank, and create a string of suits and rank.

```typescript
const deck = suits$.pipe(
    map(suit => rank$.pipe(
      map(rank => (`${suit}${rank}`)))))
```

However, this exists as four nested streams rather than one continuous flat stream. How do we fix this? We use mergeMap to merge the sub-streams into a single long continuous stream of cards. We now have a lovely little deck of cards :)

```typescript
const deck = suits$.pipe(
    mergeMap(suit => rank$.pipe(
      map(rank => (`${suit}${rank}`)))))
```

However, this is only one deck? How can we create multiple decks. We will create a range, which will create a fixed range of numbers, and for each of those we can create a deck.

```typescript
const decks = (numDecks : number) => range(0, numDecks).pipe(map(_ => deck))
```

But this poses a similar problem to the above issue with nested streams. So again, we use the power of mergeMap to flatten these streams in to one!

```typescript
const decks = (numDecks : number) => range(0, numDecks).pipe(mergeMap(_ => deck))
```

All in order, oh no, let us shuffle them. Assuming we have these functions, which can insert an element in to a random position in an array. We will use the reduce, and the randomInsertion to shuffle them.

```typescript
function impureRandomNumberGenerator(n:number) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (n+1)); // impure!!
}

function randomInsert<T>(a:readonly T[],e:T): readonly T[] {
  return (i=>[...a.slice(0,i),e,...a.slice(i)])
    (impureRandomNumberGenerator(a.length + 1))
}
const shoe = (numDecks : number) => range(0, numDecks).pipe(
  mergeMap(_ => deck),
  reduce(randomInsert, [])
)
```

This should be correct? Not quite, we `reduce` to a single value, an array. So, now our stream contains a **single** element, an array, Rather, then being a stream of elements. This array will be all of our cards, shuffled. You can see that as we hover over the element and it attempts to print the contents.

We need to turn this back into a stream. How can we do that, with the power of mergeMap! This will take our list and convert it to a stream, and then flatten it, such that our final result is a long stream of *shuffled* cards.

```typescript
const shuffledShoe = (numDecks : number) => range(0, numDecks).pipe(
  mergeMap(_ => deck),
  reduce(randomInsert, []),
  mergeMap(from)
)
```

Wow, now we have a beautiful, shiny, shuffled shoe of cards in an Observable!
